### **3. Basic Usage of Chainsaw**

Chainsaw can analyze a variety of log file formats and perform file carving. Here’s how to use it effectively.

#### **Running Chainsaw on Log Files**

Chainsaw supports multiple log formats such as **Windows Event Logs (.evtx)**, **Sysmon logs**, and other text-based logs. Here's how you can use Chainsaw to parse these logs.

1. **Running Chainsaw on Windows Event Logs**: To analyze a **Windows Event Log (.evtx)** file, use the following command:
```bash
chainsaw --input /path/to/eventlog.evtx
```

Chainsaw will process the `.evtx` log file and output relevant details like timestamps, event IDs, descriptions, and more.

2. **Extracting Specific Event IDs**: You can filter for specific event IDs by using the `--event-id` option. For example, to search for **event ID 4688** (Process Creation):
```bash
chainsaw --input /path/to/eventlog.evtx --event-id 4688
```

3. **Parsing Sysmon Logs**: To analyze **Sysmon logs** (typically stored in `.xml` format), use:
```bash
chainsaw --input /path/to/sysmon.log
```

#### **File Carving with Chainsaw**

Chainsaw also supports **file carving** for recovering fragmented or deleted files, even if they are not present in the file system's directory structure. This is useful when analyzing disk images, memory dumps, or other raw data.

1. **File Carving from Disk Image**: If you have a disk image (e.g., `.dd` or `.img`), you can use Chainsaw to carve out specific files or signatures:
```bash
chainsaw --input /path/to/disk_image.img --carve --output /path/to/output_directory
```

Chainsaw will analyze the raw disk image for recognizable file signatures and attempt to recover files. You can specify a particular file type (e.g., `.jpg`, `.pdf`, etc.) to refine the carving process.

2. **Carving Based on Known Signatures**: Chainsaw can also carve files based on known file signatures. For example, if you're looking for **JPEG images**, you can use the `--file-type` option:
```bash
chainsaw --input /path/to/rawdata.img --file-type jpeg --output /path/to/output_directory
```

3. **List Supported File Types**: Chainsaw supports a wide range of file types for carving, such as:
    - **Images**: JPG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP
    - **Documents**: PDF, DOCX, XLSX
    - **Archives**: ZIP, RAR, TAR
    - **Executables**: EXE, DLL

You can view the full list of supported file types in the documentation or use the `--help` command:
```bash
chainsaw --help
```

### **4. Advanced Chainsaw Features**

#### **Carving Based on Time Stamps**

Chainsaw can also use **timestamps** to carve files from disk images based on the file's last accessed or created time. This can be useful if you're trying to recover files that were created or modified during a specific timeframe.
```bash
chainsaw --input /path/to/disk_image.img --carve --from-time "2023-01-01" --to-time "2023-01-31" --output /path/to/output_directory
```

#### **Carving in Bulk with Wildcards**

Chainsaw allows you to specify multiple files or directories using **wildcards**. For example, to carve all `.evtx` files in a directory:
```bash
chainsaw --input /path/to/logs/*.evtx --carve --output /path/to/output_directory
```

### **5. Analyzing Event Logs with Chainsaw**

Chainsaw is particularly powerful for analyzing Windows Event Logs, especially for investigating suspicious activity. Here are some additional tips for effective log analysis:

#### **Analyzing Windows Event Logs for Specific Event IDs**

Windows Event Logs are crucial for tracking system activity, such as user logins, application installs, and system errors. Chainsaw can be used to extract and analyze these logs.

1. **Event ID Filtering**: As mentioned earlier, you can use Chainsaw to filter by **specific event IDs**. For instance:
    - **4624**: Successful Logon
    - **4634**: Logoff
    - **4688**: Process Creation (useful for detecting malware)
    - **4719**: System Time Change

```bash
chainsaw --input /path/to/eventlog.evtx --event-id 4624
```

2. **Extracting Event Details**: Chainsaw will present a detailed analysis of each event, including time, event ID, description, and any associated data (e.g., user name, process name).

#### **Using Chainsaw for Incident Response**

During an **incident response** process, you'll often need to extract information from logs to determine the scope of an attack. Chainsaw helps by providing tools to quickly parse, filter, and analyze large volumes of event logs. For instance, if you suspect a **malware infection**, you could look for the **4688 event ID** (process creation) to see what processes were executed on the system. By examining these logs, you can gain valuable insights into the attack vector, timing, and scope.

### **6. Conclusion**

Chainsaw is a highly effective tool for digital forensics investigations, especially when dealing with fragmented or deleted files in disk images, memory dumps, or logs. With its ability to parse Windows Event Logs, Sysmon logs, and more, as well as its file carving capabilities, it is an essential tool for investigators looking to recover evidence or identify suspicious activities.

By understanding the basic usage and advanced features outlined in this guide, you can integrate Chainsaw into your forensic workflow to improve your investigations and analysis efficiency. Whether you're recovering files, carving data from disk images, or analyzing logs for specific event IDs, Chainsaw provides a powerful and flexible solution.
