# Hypervisor Artifacts and Live VM Analysis Guide

In digital forensics, hypervisors and live virtual machines (VMs) present unique opportunities and challenges. Virtualization has become a core component of many enterprise environments, and the analysis of hypervisor artifacts and live VMs can reveal critical evidence during investigations. This guide will help you understand the key concepts related to hypervisor artifacts, the process of live VM analysis, and the tools and techniques used for this type of forensic analysis.

## 1. Introduction to Hypervisor Artifacts and Live VM Analysis

Virtualized environments use hypervisors (software that allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical host). Hypervisor artifacts and live VM analysis are key areas in modern digital forensics, especially as virtualization is prevalent in enterprise environments, cloud infrastructures, and cybersecurity investigations. Analyzing a hypervisor or a live VM involves extracting evidence from the host system or active virtual machines running in real-time.

**Key aspects of VM forensics:**
- **Hypervisor Artifacts**: These include files, logs, and configurations generated by the hypervisor to manage virtual machines.
- **Live VM Analysis**: This focuses on extracting and analyzing data from a running virtual machine, including memory dumps and live system data.

## 2. Types of Virtualization Environments

There are two primary types of hypervisors used in virtualized environments:

1. **Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-metal)**:
    - Runs directly on the physical hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen).
    - Provides better performance and is typically used in enterprise environments.
2. **Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted)**:
    - Runs on top of an operating system (e.g., VMware Workstation, VirtualBox).
    - Primarily used in testing and development environments.

Forensic investigators need to understand which type of hypervisor they are dealing with, as it will determine the methods for accessing and analyzing hypervisor artifacts and live VMs.

## 3. Key Hypervisor Artifacts

When conducting forensic analysis in virtualized environments, hypervisor artifacts play an essential role in preserving evidence. These artifacts include files that store configurations, virtual disks, logs, and snapshots of virtual machines.

### VM Configuration Files

- **VMX files (VMware)**: These contain configuration settings for a VM, including hardware settings, network configurations, and resource allocations.
- **XML Files (Hyper-V/VirtualBox)**: Store VM configurations similar to VMX files.

**Forensic relevance**:

- Reviewing configuration files helps investigators understand the VM's hardware setup, user interactions, and any changes made to the environment.

### Virtual Disk Files

Virtual disk files are used by the hypervisor to emulate a hard drive for the VM. Common formats include:

- **VMDK (VMware)**: The virtual disk format for VMware virtual machines.
- **VHD/VHDX (Microsoft Hyper-V)**: Virtual hard drive format used by Hyper-V.
- **VDI (VirtualBox)**: The disk image format used by VirtualBox.

**Forensic relevance**:

- Analyzing virtual disk files allows investigators to recover data from a VM, including deleted files, file system structures, and operating system artifacts.
### Snapshots

Snapshots capture the exact state of a VM at a specific point in time. They can include the VM's configuration, memory, and disk state.

**Forensic relevance**:
- Snapshots are valuable for preserving the exact state of a VM during an attack or incident. They provide a time point for investigation, allowing forensic examiners to perform incident reconstruction.

### Logs and Event Files

Hypervisors generate logs related to the operation of VMs and the hypervisor itself. Common log types include:
- **VM Logs**: These contain information about VM state changes, VM start/stop events, and errors.
- **Host Logs**: Log information from the physical host running the hypervisor.
- **Hypervisor Logs (e.g., ESXi logs)**: Logs related to hypervisor operations.

**Forensic relevance**:
- Logs can show what actions were taken by attackers or users within the virtual environment, including unauthorized access, VM manipulation, or system errors.

## 4. Live VM Analysis

Live VM analysis is the process of analyzing a running virtual machine, which can provide real-time evidence of what the VM is doing. It involves extracting memory dumps, monitoring network activity, and performing runtime analysis.

### Accessing a Live VM

To perform live analysis, you need access to the virtual machineâ€™s operating system. There are several ways to achieve this:
- **Remote Access**: Connect to the VM using RDP, SSH, or other remote access tools.
- **Snapshot/Clone**: Create a snapshot or clone of the VM if direct access is not feasible.
- **Hypervisor Console**: Use the hypervisor management console (e.g., VMware vSphere, Hyper-V Manager) to access the VM console.

### Memory Dump Analysis

Memory analysis can reveal volatile data, such as running processes, active network connections, and in-memory credentials.

#### Tools for Memory Dump Analysis:

- **Volatility 3**: A popular open-source tool for memory analysis. It can analyze memory dumps to find evidence of running processes, network connections, and other artifacts.
- **LiME**: A Linux memory extraction tool used for capturing volatile memory from Linux-based virtual machines.

To analyze memory, you first need to obtain a memory dump from the live VM:
```bash
volatility -f memory_dump.raw --profile=Win7SP1x86 pslist
```

This command will list all running processes in the memory dump.

### Network Activity Monitoring

Monitoring network activity on a live VM can help detect malicious communications or unauthorized data exfiltration. Tools like **Wireshark** or **tcpdump** can be used to capture network traffic.

To monitor live network activity, you can use:
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w network_traffic.pcap
```

This will capture network packets on the `eth0` interface and save them to a `.pcap` file for later analysis.

## 5. Tools for Hypervisor and Live VM Analysis

Several tools are available to assist with hypervisor and live VM analysis:

### Volatility 3 for Memory Analysis

- **Volatility** is a memory forensics framework for analyzing memory dumps from both physical systems and virtual machines.
- It can be used to extract detailed information about running processes, network activity, loaded drivers, and more.

### FTK Imager and EnCase for Disk Image Analysis

- Both **FTK Imager** and **EnCase** are widely used tools for creating disk images and analyzing virtual disks.
- These tools allow investigators to analyze virtual disk files (e.g., VMDK, VHD) and recover data.

### Network Analysis Tools

- **Wireshark**: Used for capturing and analyzing network packets, helping identify suspicious activity in VM network traffic.
- **tcpdump**: A command-line tool for network packet capture and analysis.

## 6. Best Practices for Hypervisor Forensics

- **Avoid Altering the VM**: Always work with a copy of the virtual machine and avoid interacting with the live environment unless necessary.
- **Use Snapshots**: If possible, take a snapshot of the VM before starting the analysis to preserve its current state.
- **Document Everything**: Keep detailed logs of every step taken during the analysis process to ensure the integrity of the investigation.
- **Work with Experts**: Collaboration with cloud and virtualization experts can help to better understand the inner workings of the hypervisor and its artifacts.

## 7. Conclusion

Hypervisor artifacts and live VM analysis are vital forensics techniques used to investigate incidents within virtualized environments. Whether it's extracting virtual disk files, analyzing memory dumps, or reviewing hypervisor logs, understanding how to navigate these elements allows forensic professionals to uncover crucial evidence.
