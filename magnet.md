### **Step 2: Collecting Cloud Data Using Magnet AXIOM**

Magnet AXIOM supports many popular cloud sources. Hereâ€™s how to set up the collection:

1. **Select the Data Sources**:
    - **Cloud Sources**: AXIOM allows you to collect evidence from multiple cloud sources such as:
        - **Google** (Gmail, Google Drive, etc.)
        - **Microsoft** (OneDrive, Outlook, etc.)
        - **Apple** (iCloud)
        - **Dropbox**
        - **Facebook**, **Instagram**, **Twitter**, **WhatsApp**, and more.
    - **Cloud Storage**: You can also select cloud storage providers like Box, iCloud, and Amazon S3.
    - **Email Services**: If relevant, you can configure email collection from Gmail, Office 365, or other IMAP/SMTP accounts.

2. **Connecting to Cloud Accounts**:
    - Select the **"Cloud"** option when choosing data sources.
    - Choose the cloud service from the available list.
    - **Authentication**: Depending on the service, you'll need to authenticate using OAuth (for services like Google or Microsoft), provide credentials (username and password), or use API keys (for services like Dropbox).
        - For instance, with **Google**:
            - Use your browser to authenticate with the Google account.
            - If you are collecting data from Microsoft OneDrive or Office 365, follow the prompts to authenticate using a Microsoft account.

3. **Configure Collection Settings**:
    - **Scope of Data**: Choose the scope of the data you want to collect (full device or specific data such as cloud storage, emails, etc.).
    - **Time Frame**: Optionally, specify the time range for which you want to collect data, for example, last 30 days, or a custom date range.
    - **Data Types**: Select the types of cloud data you want to capture:
        - **Emails**
        - **Contacts**
        - **Documents and Files** (Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.)
        - **Calendar events**
        - **Messages** (Social media, chat services, etc.)
        - **Photos and Videos**

4. **Initiate Data Collection**:
    - Click **Start** after selecting your desired data and configuring the collection options.
    - Magnet AXIOM will begin pulling data from the selected cloud sources.
    - Depending on the amount of data and the speed of the connection, this process can take from a few minutes to several hours.

### **Step 3: Analyzing Collected Cloud Data**

Once the collection is complete, Magnet AXIOM will start the analysis phase. AXIOM automatically organizes the collected data into different categories to make the forensic process more efficient:

1. **Examine Cloud Evidence**:
    - **Cloud Files**: View the documents and files uploaded to or downloaded from cloud storage services.
    - **Emails**: Examine collected emails, including sent/received messages, attachments, timestamps, and metadata.
    - **Contacts and Calendars**: Review contact information and calendar entries from email providers like Google or Microsoft.
    - **Photos and Videos**: View multimedia files collected from cloud storage services like Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox, etc.
    - **Chat Logs**: Examine chat history from platforms like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or Instagram.

2. **Metadata Extraction**:
    - AXIOM automatically extracts metadata from files, emails, and other cloud data sources, such as:
        - **Timestamps**: Created, modified, accessed dates
        - **File Path Information**: Location of the file within cloud storage.
        - **File Metadata**: Size, hash, and other details.

3. **Search and Filter**:
    - Use the built-in **search** functionality to find specific keywords, email addresses, or any other relevant data.
    - Apply filters based on dates, file types, or other criteria to narrow down your findings.

4. **Analyze Artifacts**:
    - AXIOM automatically categorizes and analyzes data, making it easier for you to spot artifacts such as:
        - **Deleted Files**: If the cloud service allows for recovery of deleted files.
        - **Login and Authentication Events**: These can help trace access to the account and identify suspicious behavior.
        - **Timestamps and File Activity**: Trace the history of file access, modification, and sharing.

### **Step 4: Generating Reports**

Once the analysis is complete, you can generate detailed forensic reports of the cloud data collected:

1. **Generate Custom Reports**:
    - You can generate custom reports from the data analyzed in AXIOM. Reports can include:
        - **Cloud activity** (files, emails, logs, etc.)
        - **User activity** (logins, modifications, etc.)
        - **File and Email Metadata**
    - Reports can be in different formats such as **PDF**, **HTML**, or **XML**.

2. **Export Data for Further Analysis**:
    - Magnet AXIOM allows you to export the evidence (files, emails, etc.) to a local disk or an external storage device for further review.

3. **Create Summary Reports**:
    - Summarize key findings, such as file uploads, email exchanges, and timeline events in a format suitable for presentation in court or to other stakeholders.

### **Step 5: Legal Considerations and Chain of Custody**

Magnet AXIOM maintains chain of custody and provides detailed timestamps, system logs, and reports to support the integrity of the evidence. It's essential to follow proper forensic procedures:

1. **Preserve the Original Evidence**:
    - Ensure that any cloud data extracted is done so in a forensically sound manner and without altering or corrupting the original evidence.

2. **Chain of Custody Documentation**:
    - Maintain proper chain of custody logs for the cloud evidence. Document the date and time of collection, who performed the extraction, and where the data is stored.

3. **Data Integrity**:
    - AXIOM uses hashing (MD5/SHA) to ensure data integrity and prevent tampering with the collected evidence.

### **Step 6: Advanced Cloud Forensics Features in AXIOM**

1. **Mobile Device Integration**:
    - AXIOM integrates with mobile forensics, allowing you to pull cloud data from mobile devices that sync with cloud accounts (Google, iCloud, etc.).

2. **Social Media Forensics**:
    - AXIOM allows integration with social media platforms, capturing posts, images, comments, and messages from platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

3. **Data Recovery**:
    - AXIOM includes functionality for recovering deleted cloud data, depending on the platform and the retention policies of the cloud provider.
